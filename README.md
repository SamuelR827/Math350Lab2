1.) Fit a regression model of Y vs X for your two groups for Degudent and Zirkonzahn using Cut Level for
X and ΔE 00 for Y. Provide the scatter plot with the regression curve and a summary of your regression
analysis. Comment on how well your model fits the data.

See the attached picture for the scatter plot: <Pictures/Degudent_Group_Cut_Level_vs_E00.png>

In our regression analysis for both the Degudent and Zirkonzahn groups, we created a linear regression model with Cut Level as the independent variable and ΔE00 as the dependent variable.

Degudent Group:

    Model Fit: The R-squared is 0.978, meaning 97.8% of the variation in ΔE00 can be explained by Cut Level.
    Coefficients: The intercept is -1.0951, and the slope for Cut Level is 0.0299, indicating a positive relationship between Cut Level and ΔE00.
    Statistical Significance: The p-value for Cut Level is extremely low, confirming a significant fit.

Zirkonzahn Group:

    Model Fit: The R-squared is 0.980, so 98.0% of the variation in ΔE00 is explained by Cut Level.
    Coefficients: The intercept is 0.3253, and the slope is 0.0156, also indicating a positive relationship.
    Statistical Significance: Similar to Degudent, the p-value is very low, showing a significant fit.

Overall, both models fit well, with R-squared values close to 1, showing that Cut Level is a strong predictor of ΔE00 for both groups. The Degudent group has a slightly higher slope, suggesting that ΔE00 increases more steeply with Cut Level compared to Zirkonzahn.
