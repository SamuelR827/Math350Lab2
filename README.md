1.) Fit a regression model of Y vs X for your two groups for Degudent and Zirkonzahn using Cut Level for
X and ΔE 00 for Y. Provide the scatter plot with the regression curve and a summary of your regression
analysis. Comment on how well your model fits the data.

See the attached picture for the scatter plot: <Pictures/Degudent_Group_Cut_Level_vs_E00.png>

In our regression analysis for both the Degudent and Zirkonzahn groups, we created a linear regression model with Cut Level as the independent variable and ΔE00 as the dependent variable.

Degudent Group:

    Model Fit: The R-squared is 0.978, meaning 97.8% of the variation in ΔE00 can be explained by Cut Level.
    Coefficients: The intercept is -1.0951, and the slope for Cut Level is 0.0299, indicating a positive relationship between Cut Level and ΔE00.
    Statistical Significance: The p-value for Cut Level is extremely low, confirming a significant fit.

Zirkonzahn Group:

    Model Fit: The R-squared is 0.980, so 98.0% of the variation in ΔE00 is explained by Cut Level.
    Coefficients: The intercept is 0.3253, and the slope is 0.0156, also indicating a positive relationship.
    Statistical Significance: Similar to Degudent, the p-value is very low, showing a significant fit.

Overall, both models fit well, with R-squared values close to 1, showing that Cut Level is a strong predictor of ΔE00 for both groups. The Degudent group has a slightly higher slope, suggesting that ΔE00 increases more steeply with Cut Level compared to Zirkonzahn.

2.) Use the regression lines above to estimate the predicted value of the cut level for the acceptability
threshold of ΔE 00=1.8 μm:
Given the linear regression equation ^y=b0 +b1 x and the specified value yh, we want to estimate the
corresponding level xh that gave rise to it. We obtain a point estimator by solving the estimated
regression equation for x by^xh= yh−b0
b1, where b1 ≠ 0.
